        <p>
          Welcome Readers!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a management graduate and as I'm always curious to explore new things, I developed an interest to work
          with
          data.After a lot of self
          introspection,I felt that data is the only thing which will keep me busy all the time and not letting me to
          the routine-monotonous work.In this page you will see my journey at MSIT- with my favorite courses and
          different
          sort of Experiences
          through the
          program till now.
