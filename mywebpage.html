  <h2>About me Section</h2>

  <p>
    Welcome Folks!!
  </p>

  <p>
    Being a management graduate and as I'm always curious to explore new things, I developed an interest to work with
    data.After a lot of self
    introspection,I felt that data is the only thing which will keep me busy all the time and not letting me to the
    routine-monotonous work.So here I'm persuing my MSIT- the path which will take me to where i want to go..
    In this page you will see my journey at MSIT- with my favorite courses and different sort of Experiences through the
    program till now.
