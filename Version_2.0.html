          Welcome Readers!!
        </p>

        <p>
          Being a management graduate and as I'm always curious to explore new things, I developed an interest to work
          with
          data.After a lot of self
          introspection,I felt that data is the only thing which will keep me busy all the time and not letting me to
          the
          routine-monotonous work.So here I'm, persuing my MSIT- the path which will take me to where i want to go..
          In this page you will see my journey at MSIT- with my favorite courses and different sort of Experiences
          through the
          program till now.

        <h2>My Experiences</h2>
        <div>We learn manythings from our own experiences most of the time. There are many lessons for me,which i
          experienced
          and learnt from my journey at MSIT.
        </div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Each course has its own flavor.So never ever conclude anything by looking up at its tiltle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Given resources and a mentor, you can learn any language or any skill, even when time is a constraint.
          </li>
          <li>
            Never underestimate any cousre, you dont know which will come handy at your hard times.
          </li>
          <li>
            Should maintain the same level of enthusiasm, creativity till the end of the course.
