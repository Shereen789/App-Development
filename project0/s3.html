        <p>A Lion and a Man chanced to travel in a company through the forest. They soon began to quarrel, for each of
            them
            boasted
            that he and his kind were far superior to the other both in strength and mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now they reached a clearing in the forest and there stood a statue. It was a representation of Heracles in
            the
            act of
            tearing the jaws of the Nemean Lion.

            “See,” said the man, “that’s how strong we are! The King of Beasts is like wax in our hands!”

            “Ho!” laughed the Lion, “a Man made that statue. It would have been quite a different scene had a Lion made
            it!”
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            Moral: It all depends on the point of view, and who tells the story. Always trust your own wit and try
            judge
            the
            circumstances.
