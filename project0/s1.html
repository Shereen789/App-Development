        <h4>The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf</h4>
        <p>A Shepherd Boy tended his master’s Sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in
            the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd’s
            pipe.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a
            Wolf,he thought of a plan to amuse himself. His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack
            the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked
            like
            a Wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, “Wolf! Wolf!”
        </p>
        <p>
            As he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the
            pasture. But when they got there they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on
            them. A
            few day later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, “Wolf! Wolf!” Again the Villagers ran to help him, only to be
            laughed at
            again.
        </p>
        <p>Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the
            pasture,a
            Wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep.In terror the Boy ran toward the village
            shouting “Wolf! Wolf!” But though the Villagers heard the cry, they
            did not run to help him as they had before. “He cannot fool us again,” they said.The Wolf killed a great
            many of the Boy’s sheep and then slipped away into the forest.
        </p>

            Moral: If you keep lying, no one will believe you even if you are speaking the truth. Always speak the
            truth.
