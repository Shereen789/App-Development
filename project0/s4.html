                    Quite clearly the way forward was do as the boss said. There was no question. He was always right.
                    Lucy Turnbull was not
                    happy though. The system they were installing as far as she was concerned was defective. It left
                    them vulnerable. They
                    had significant value in clients’ funds that needed a very serious degree of protection. The system
                    should have a
                    built-in failsafe but didn’t. That surely was a mistake.

                    Lucy had worked at the solicitors for a good number of years. The office manager. Organising,
                    arranging, dealing with
                    the constant stream of contrary clients that fell through the door every day. The practice was large
                    with around twenty
                    six legals, that’s how she referred to them, covering a vast array of fields. And all their support
                    staff. They varied
                    in competence. There were a few that were just simply a pain in the arse. The legal side of their
                    work was fine after
                    all she did not get involved in that. The administration though, that was something else. And it was
                    her job to stick it
                    all together and keep it stuck together. Regardless. In short they muck it up, she unmucks it. The
                    result is overwork.

                    She gets into the office early. Very early. Every day. Way before anyone else. The cleaners are
                    still cleaning when she
                    arrives. They have at least thirty minutes to finish. That’s how early she is. The vacuum cleaner
                    belting out it’s
                    irritating whine. Whizzing round her feet. So irritating. But she puts up with it. They have a job
                    to do and she needs
                    every minute of the extra time. She uses this time to work on the new system while no one is in the
                    office who can
                    scupper her adjustments by pressing inappropriate buttons. When all the many computers are silent.

                    Then shortly before nine the chaos starts again. All those secretaries arrive instantly fussing
                    about this or demanding
                    that. Everything that happens in that office is urgent. Needed to be completed yesterday or even
                    better one week before
                    the work started. But she is calm, the epitome of efficiency. She has that rare ability of being
                    able to iron out
                    problems without even a blink of the eye. That is why she is so valuable to the practice. That is
                    why she is so trusted.
                    That is why they are confident just to leave her in charge of all those funds. The few millions of
                    pounds that just
                    simply linger, waiting for the nod, the confirmation that completes the deal. The deal that is the
                    culmination of, in
                    some cases, many months work involving copious amounts of paper and an overabundance of words. Legal
                    words. The text
                    designed to eliminate ambiguity. Those millions just sitting, waiting, tempting. All locked within a
                    system that has no
                    failsafe. That is inherently vulnerable.

                    The police arrive nine forty five on Tuesday morning. Mr Blackwood-Smith the practice leader in
                    attendance. It is he
                    that has noticed the discrepancy. The two and three quarter million pounds that has disappeared from
                    the clients’
                    account. “How is this possible?” he asks Lucy. She mentions the inadequate system but this of course
                    is not acceptable.
                    Mr Blackwood-Smith is always right. Lucy is hauled off to the police station. To answer some very
                    serious questions.
                    Face accusations. Her bank accounts are inspected. Her affairs scrutinised. The supposed secret
                    funds to be exposed. She
                    is the prime suspect. In fact the only suspect. The only person in the entire practice that has
                    access to everything.
                    So, she is charged and bailed awaiting trial.

                    Three months after Lucy committed the offence, on a beach in Mexico a young lady is relaxing on a
                    sun bed, in the sun,
                    drinking a freshly made Margarita. She is maybe twenty three and recently graduated from university
                    with a double first.
                    She is well off. Quite rich in fact. She is very happy. She is very happy in particular to be away
                    from that awful
                    cleaning job. Having to manoeuvre around that miserable lady who always arrived early. The lady who
                    dismissed the
                    cleaners as a nuisance. Was indiscreet. Logged on and navigated her computer in full view of the
                    young computer
                    technology student in charge of the vacuum cleaner.
