        <h4 style="text-align:center;font-weight:bolder;color:purple;">The Farmer and the Snake
        </h4>
        <p>
            A Farmer walked through his field one cold winter morning. On the ground lay a Snake, stiff and frozen with
            the
            cold.
            The Farmer knew how deadly the Snake could be, and yet he picked it up and put it in his bosom to warm it
            back
            to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Snake soon revived, and when it had enough strength, bit the man who had been so kind to it. The bite
            was
            deadly and
            the Farmer felt that he must die. As he drew his last breath, he said to those standing around, “Learn from
            my
            fate not
            to take pity on a scoundrel”.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            Moral: There are some who never changes their nature, regardless of how good we behave with them. Always
            stay
            alert and
            maintain the distance from those who are there only thinking about their own benefits.
